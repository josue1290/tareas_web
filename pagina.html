                        We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about the future 
                        - we’re not sure what the future holds either.
                        <br><br>
                        That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, 
                        and we’re going to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.
                        <br><br>
                        But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we’ll be here 
                        — every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
